# MotionGfx

MotionGfx is a motion graphics creation tool powered by [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) ECS.

*Associated example [here](./examples/hello_world.rs)!*

## Running Examples

```bash
# Clone the repo and run the examples
git clone https://github.com/voxell-tech/motiongfx
cd motiongfx
cargo run --example hello_world
```

## Goal

The goal of this tool is to procedurally generate animations with code. Below are some of the core design principles used in MotionGfx:

- Ease of use.
- Performance by default.
- Real-time preview.
- First class support for Bevy ECS.
- 2 way playback support.
- Robust (can be used not just for animation productions, but for all sorts of applications e.g. game development).

## Why this tool?

Procedurally coded animations can be easily scaled to larger projects (e.g. code can be reused/extended/structured).

- **Streamlining timeline editing with code-based animation.** Reorganizing strips and keyframes, particularly when rearranging clips, can be a laborious endeavor. However, with coded animations, the process becomes remarkably efficient. Swapping sections in the timeline is as simple as shifting lines of code up and down, allowing for swift and hassle-free adjustments.

  Here is an image (by [aarthificial](https://youtu.be/WTUafAwrunE)) comparing keyframes and code:

- **Seamless version control.** With most of our assets represented as code or serialized values, we seamlessly integrate version control using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)!
- **Unleashing the full power of programming for animation.** In animation, tasks such as handling repetitions, reusing common effects, and more become a breeze by harnessing programming concepts like loops and functions.

### 2 way playback support

In addition to all of the above, MotionGfx also provides 2 way playback support. This means that the animations you created can be played in both forward and backward directions without any extra computational cost! This is a feature that is very lacking in other code-based animation libraries.

## Easing Functions

MotionGfx also comes with built-in easing functions which are crucial for animation creation.

## Typst Integration (Coming soon...)

MotionGfx seamlessly integrates with [Typst](https://typst.app) via the [Velyst](https://github.com/voxell-tech/velyst) crate.
